# Voice Assistant

Laura is a simple voice assistant created just for fun. Just run main.py, awake Laura with "hey, Laura" and ask her stuff! She currently tells you the date, time and weather forecast for your location.

This project has no commercial purposes and is not intended for production, it is just some fun coding.
